The MATLAB program analyzes the cross-correlation and auto-correlation properties of Walsh-Hadamard codes. Cross-correlation plots should ideally show minimal correlation between different codes, while auto-correlation plots for each code should ideally exhibit sharp peaks at zero lag, indicating self-similarity. Any deviations from these expectations could indicate issues with orthogonality or code integrity.
