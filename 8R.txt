EX1:
In the simulation using RS(7,3) coding and decoding with a Galois field GF(2^3), the original message composed of three 3-symbol words was successfully encoded into a codeword of length 7, adding redundancy to enable error correction. When noise was introduced by simulating symbol errors in the received message, the RS decoder managed to correct 2 symbol errors in each of the first two rows, maintaining the integrity of the corresponding message words. However, in the third row, despite attempting error correction, the code encountered an unrecoverable error, as indicated by the -1 value in the cnumerr variable, highlighting the limits of the code's error correction capability in handling distributed symbol errors beyond its threshold.

EX2:
The simulation focused on designing a block interleaver for a Reed-Solomon code with parameters n=255 (RS codeword length), k=235 (number of data symbols), and b=20 (expected burst error length from the channel). The error correction capability of the RS code was calculated as t=10, indicating it can correct up to 10 symbols. Since the expected burst error length b is less than t, the interleaving technique was determined not to significantly aid in this scenario. The interleaver input data, constructed by repeating a pattern to match the codeword length, underwent block interleaving, simulating a burst error by marking 20 symbols with '*'. After deinterleaving, the output showed successful error correction, highlighting the effectiveness of the RS code's inherent error correction capability even without interleaving assistance.
