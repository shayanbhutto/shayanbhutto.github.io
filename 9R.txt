The simulation aims to assess the Bit Error Rate (BER) versus Eb/N0 performance of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system using BPSK modulation in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Here's a discussion of the results:
1.	Simulation Parameters:
•	𝑁=64N=64 (FFT size or total number of subcarriers)
•	𝑁𝑠𝑑=48Nsd=48 (Number of data subcarriers)
•	𝑁𝑠𝑝=4Nsp=4 (Number of pilot subcarriers)
•	𝑜𝑓𝑑𝑚𝐵𝑊=20×106ofdmBW=20×106 (OFDM bandwidth)
2.	Derived Parameters:
•	𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝐹=0.3125deltaF=0.3125 MHz (Bandwidth for each subcarrier)
•	𝑇𝑓𝑓𝑡=3.2Tfft=3.2 μs (IFFT/FFT period)
•	𝑇𝑔𝑖=0.8Tgi=0.8 μs (Guard interval duration)
•	𝑇𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙=4Tsignal=4 μs (Total duration of BPSK-OFDM symbol)
•	𝑁𝑐𝑝=16Ncp=16 (Number of symbols allocated to cyclic prefix)
•	𝑁𝑠𝑡=52Nst=52 (Number of total used subcarriers)
•	𝑛𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑠𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑆𝑦𝑚=52nBitsPerSym=52 (Number of Bits per Symbol for BPSK)
3.	Simulation Results:
•	The simulation evaluates the BER performance over a range of Eb/N0 values (-20 dB to 8 dB) for 10,000 OFDM symbols.
•	Theoretical BER curves are calculated using the formula for BPSK modulation over AWGN.
•	The simulated BER results are plotted against Eb/N0, showing the system's actual performance in an AWGN channel.
4.	Performance Analysis:
•	The plotted BER curve showcases how the system's performance degrades as the Eb/N0 ratio decreases, indicating higher noise levels.
•	A comparison between the simulated BER and theoretical BER helps assess the system's deviation from ideal performance under AWGN conditions.
•	The simulation provides insights into the robustness of the OFDM system with BPSK modulation, highlighting its resilience or vulnerability to noise in practical communication scenarios.
Overall, this simulation and analysis contribute to understanding the trade-offs and performance characteristics of OFDM systems, particularly in terms of error rates under varying signal-to-noise ratios, which is crucial for designing reliable communication systems.
